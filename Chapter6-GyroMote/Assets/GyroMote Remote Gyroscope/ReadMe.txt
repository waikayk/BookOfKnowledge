About:
------

GyroMote the remote gyroscope (hence the name GyroMote) is an app designed for developers using Unity3D. The app supplies live gyroscope information over WiFi to your desktop development environment. This makes testing your application or game a lot easier.

Instead of compiling your app to run on the mobile device every time you change your game in the editor, you can just run the game in the Unity3D editor simulator and connect to the remote gyroscope running on your iOS device.

You gain access to the following information:

* (unbiased) rotation rate
* gravity vector
* user acceleration vector
* device attitude

Both of your desktop and iOS device have to be in the same network in order to be able to successfully connect. You do not need to have an Android or iOS mobile license for GyroMote work. The initial release will not support Android mobile devices. If you must have an Android version, please contact me. It will also only work in C# script and not JavaScript.

Attention:
----------

This package is intended to work with a companion server app available for purchase from the Apple app store for iOS. Although this Unity asset store package is free, the companion app might be not.
