--ProGrids Full Description--
ProGrids is another sixbyseven tool that aims to introduce an industry standard feature to Unity 3Dgrids!
While it might not be the most flashy or eye-catching tool, it will quickly become the one tool
you always, always use. There's a very good reason every serious game engine (and 3d package) has a
grid system- its simply essential.
With the grid toggled ON, anything you move in the Unity Editor, from any view port, will snap to the
grid as it moves. The object is not just moving in increments- this is real, precise grid snapping at
work! You can always toggle the grid snapping OFF or ON with a single click via the floating control
panel.
Visually, ProGrids will display a grid overlay in all isometric views (top, front, left, etc). It
automatically detects and displays the correct grid for each axis, and even colors the grid for easy
identification.
Need to change the grid's snap size? From the panel, simply choose the unit type (meters,
centimeters, feet, or inches), and type the desired snap size. Both the visual and "functional" grid
will update instantly!
Lastly, the handy angle guides will help you precisely move your items along 45 and 90 degree paths,
a feature you will find extremely useful in complex levels.
